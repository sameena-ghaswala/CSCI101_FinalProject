# CSCI101_FinalProject
The program is designed to decode a visual message from a set of characters and coordinates provided in a text file. It begins by opening the input file and performing an initial pass to determine the boundaries of the grid by identifying the maximum x and y coordinate values. Once these dimensions are established, the program initializes a 2D vector structure (acting as an array) and fills it entirely with space characters to create a clean canvas for the output. The program then resets and reads the input file a second time, populating the 2D vector by placing specific characters at their corresponding (y, x) positions. Finally, the program uses a nested loop structure to iterate through the rows and columns of the grid, printing each character to the console to reveal a hidden message of block-annotated letters, which in this case is “EICMDKO”.
